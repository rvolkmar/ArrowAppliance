## Arrow Appliances â€” Tailwind update

### What I changed

- Replaced some of the inline CSS in `index.html` with Tailwind.
- Converted the header, main content, and footer to use Tailwind utility classes.
- Made the layout responsive using Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg). The nav collapses to a mobile menu on small screens (finally workin).

## How to try

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or open it from your file manager).
2. Resize the browser window to see responsive changes at breakpoints.

## Notes to myself

- Still working on mobile navigation
